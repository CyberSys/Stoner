A example of using the (dogma framework)[https://github.com/FWolfe/dogma],

* discord - a discord bot component, using disco-py

* irc - a minimal irc client, using irclite

* pz - a component that uses pyZomboid to load and execute Project Zomboid's lua files

* wsgi - a minimal wsgi web server, capable of serving dynamic or static files
